                        Since October 01, 2019, citizens of 53 countries can visit St. Petersburg, the Leningrad Region and Kaliningrad for the period of up to 8 days using e-visa. Applying for e-visa using the IntouchRussia visa service in English, you will get a visa quickly and without any errors. We will take care of the e-visa processing on your behalf and deliver the issued e-visa in accordance with your order. An e-visa is submitted in Russian or English directly to the electronic system of the  <a href='https://evisa.kdmid.ru/' target="_blank">Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>. The issued e-visa is a separate document which is to be submitted to the border authority upon entry and exit from Russia.

                    <span>
                        It is very important not to make mistakes in the e-visa, as it does not go through the consulate, where they can verify the correctness of the data. Border authorities can block entry into the country even for the slightest mistake in your e-visa.
